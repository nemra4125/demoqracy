DemoQRacy is an open source project that serves two purposes:

It's an example of building a fully-featured web application, with a Python 2.7 App Engine backend and frontend code using some HTML5 elements and various JavaScript libraries.

It's also a useful tool that you can use to coordinate voting in contests without having to deploy it yourselfâ€”see http://www.demoqracy.com
